/**
 * 1. learn how to use editor.js or wahtever api we decide to go with 
 * 2. work on creating function that can sanitize the data
 * 3. use that function on the articles
 * 4. test on postman
 * 
 * //using query placeholders to ensure user input is treated as data and not executable code
 * //use prepared statements, helps ensure user input always treated as data rather than executable code
 * //use express-validator api
